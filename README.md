# WIP - AQI Monitor
Monitors local air quality via the [IQAir API](https://www.iqair.com/us/dashboard) and sends email alerts when AQI falls or rises into a new quality zone.

I live in WA state. During the major West Coast wildfires of September 2020, I wanted to keep track of major changes in my town's air quality without having to continuously refresh the AirNow website. Waiting anxiously until I can go back out and run again.
