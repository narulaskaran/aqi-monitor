# AQI Monitor
Monitors local air quality via the AirNow.gov website and sends SMS threshold alerts when AQI falls or rises into a new quality class. 

I live in WA state. During the major West Coast wildfires during September of 2020, I wanted to keep track of major changes in my town's air quality without having to continuously refresh the AirNow website.
